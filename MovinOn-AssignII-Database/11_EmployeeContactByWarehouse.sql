/* Purpose: Create a list to access employees via warehouse */

-- Darnell sometimes needs to contact the warehouse managers, accountants, administrative assistants, 
-- and other employees at the warehouse where they work. Create a contact list that he can use to phone 
-- employees, and that contains enough information to identity employees, their positions, and their warehouses 
-- along with the warehouse phone number. Because Darnell might eventually use this list as the basis for a report, 
-- the employeeâ€™s name should appear as one full name, with the last name first. When you show this query to Darnell, 
-- he realizes that it would be more helpful if he could specify a particular warehouse before producing the list, 
-- and then see the contact information only for the employees who work in that warehouse. Create a script that meets 
-- these needs, saving it as 11_EmployeeContactByWarehouse.
