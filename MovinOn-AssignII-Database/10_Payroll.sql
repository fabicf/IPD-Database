-- salary or hourly pay rate. The list must also include Social Security Numbers and employee IDs 
-- so that an outside firm can properly process the payroll. Produce an employee list that provides 
-- this information, and sort it so that itâ€™s easy to find an employee by name. for those employees 
-- who are on a salary, the list should show their monthly wage. Save this script as 10_Payroll.
